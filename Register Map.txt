Register Map:
R4 - Used in the Delay macro as the counter, used during multiplication macro
R5 - Used as loop counter when needed, used during multiplication macro
R6 - Intermediary for generating the random sequence (gets groups of two bits per LED), product of multiplication macro
R7 - Intermediary for generating the random sequence (used for determining which LED to turn on)
R8 - Contains the round's sequence generated by the MSP430 in the appropiate format.
R9 - Contains the number of LEDs used in a round 
R10 - Intermediary for storing the user's input (copies P2IN)
R11 - Counter for how many rounds with the same amount of LEDs.
R12 - Contains the sequence entered by the user in the appropiate format.
R13 - If R13=0001h, the game is in No-LED mode (only sounds)
R14 - Delay for the sequence during the game
R15 - Random number stored in this register.
