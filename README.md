# Project Specification
The task is to recreate the popular game “Simon Says”. The game consists in repeating the pattern generated by the microcontroller. To illustrate said pattern, 4 LEDs and a buzzer will be implemented.


# Game Description
When the game is turned on, it will request the difficulty to be played. At the start of a round, the microcontroller will generate a pattern that will be shown with the LEDs and their corresponding sounds using the buzzer. The player must replicate the sequence given. If the player fails, he/she would have to start all over again, as the game will end. However, if the player enters the correct pattern, he/she advances to the next round. Every 5 rounds, the number of LEDs in the pattern will increase, until all 20 rounds are over.
